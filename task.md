Create a client-side only rendered Nuxt 3 application that allows people to sign up for a product. The form should contain fields for email and password, which should be required and show an error if no value is entered. The password field should have a way to make the password visible. The user should be able to choose to receive occasional product updates and announcements. Once signed up, they should be presented with a success page.
